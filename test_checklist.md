- [ ] Python path configuration works correctly
- [ ] Interpreter selection persists between sessions

### **Exception Handling**
```python
# test_exceptions.py
def risky_operation():
    return 1 / 0  # Zero division error

    print(f"Caught exception: {e}")
```

    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"Thread {thread_id} finished")

threads = []
for i in range(3):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker_function, args=(i,))
