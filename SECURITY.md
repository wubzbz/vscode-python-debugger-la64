## Reporting Security Issues

**This is an unofficial community-maintained port for LoongArch64 architecture.**

**This project is NOT officially supported by Microsoft.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it through:

**Preferred method:** Send an email to wubzbz@126.com

**Alternative:** Open a regular issue with `[SECURITY]` prefix in the title

Please do **NOT** report security vulnerabilities related to this LoongArch64 port 
to the original Microsoft security channels, as they **do not** support this 
unofficial architecture port.

## Response Time

As a community-maintained project, we will make our best effort to respond to 
security reports in a timely manner, but cannot guarantee specific response times.

## Scope

This security policy applies only to the LoongArch64-specific modifications 
and components in this fork. For security issues in the original codebase, 
please follow the [official security reporting process](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-debugger/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
